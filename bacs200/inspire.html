        What makes a hero? A hero is someone that has grit and never gives up.
        Heroes are shinning role models to look up to. Therefore who we select as
        role models says a lot about who we are as people.
    </p>
    <p>
        The heroes that I most admire have the following characteristics.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Unyeilding-Don't stay down for long</li>
        <li>Enable others - help others acheive their goals</li>
        <li>Humble - does not boastful about success</li>
        <li>Generous - sees others in need and gives without hesitation </li>
        <li>Integrity - they live true to their calling</li>
    </ul>

        He may not be a world changing figure, but I find him to be one of the best role models of today. He has felt numerous hardships including: 
        his father leaving at three, He attended 4 different high schools and struggled with dyslexia, his best friend River Phoenix died of a drug overdose at 23, 
        1999 Jennifer Syme was pregnant with their daughter, but the child was stillborn and it cost them their relationship,
        18 months later, Jennifer was killed in a car accident, His sister had leukemia.
        He suffered through all this, yet he still tries to help others. He gives a large sum of his wealth to charities, 
        largely those working on leukemia treatment. He lives in a two-bedroom home, instead of the mansion he could afford. 
        And finally he is down to earth, like riding the subway even though he is worth over $100 million. 
        He is a great example of success in the face of overwhelming adversity.
