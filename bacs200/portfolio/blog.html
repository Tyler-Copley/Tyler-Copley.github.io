    <p class="text-center"> COVID has changed the way we communicate with those around us. Outside of the obvious (masks, social distancing, quarantine, etc.) it has turned everyone into a germaphobe. Which can be argued to be helpful or harmful for our immune systems.  No more shaking hands or reusing pens. For some the new ways of interacting are great and necessary, it has made some feel safer going out. but for the rest it has added a whole lot of new and tedious hoops to jump through. But one thing we can all relate to is being late because you forgot your mask at home.

    <h2 class="display-4 text-center text-secondary bg-link p-4">Economic Implications</h2>
   
    <p class="text-left"> From what I have seen, it is commonly agreed that the virus has tanked the economy.  Leaders have done their best to keep it afloat but having most of the market shut down seemed to be too much for many small businesses. With so many shutting down and failing, it will definitely be difficult for any leader to turn the economy around. Although, with everything being shut down and people being locked at home, many people have gotten the chance to focus on their home life. It has given some people the opportunity to become closer to their families, pick up old hobbies they lost time for, and even pick up a few new ones.  </p>
    
    <h2 class="display-4 text-center text-secondary bg-link p-4">Political Implications</h2>
    
    <p class="text-left"> The virus has made a quite the uproar in the political world. Take the viewpoints on how our president has handled the pandemic. Some say he has done a fantastic job with the situation and information he was given, while some are saying the polar opposite. With my viewpoints aside, you canâ€™t talk politics right now without ending up on the topic of COVID. The virus is even related to potentially changing how our country votes during elections. The current political realm is being driven and controlled by the appearance of Corona.

    <h2 class="display-4 text-center text-secondary bg-link p-4">Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="text-left"> In conclusion, I am personally exhausted with the constant daily changes and updates on how to approach mundane tasks. I think the pandemic is being blown up more than it needs to be with unreliable data, and would personally like for everything to start calming down. With all the different new and varying viewpoints on what is the best course of action, it is hard to determine a acceptable balance between what is good for the country and what is good for the individual.  </p>
